#CHARITY OR ME

A #Campathon Project to Monetize Procrastination

The project is a todo-list web-based application for the purpose of inspiring humans to achieve our long and short term goals, from shipping a project to putting on socks.

Currently leading To-Do List Manager apps on the market, such as Apple's Reminder and Google's Task, are fairly straight-forward: You just set a task and check it off once completed. Sure, you get the relief of completion, but the only drive those apps add a checkmark. Sometimes, that just isn't enough incentive for one to perform. 

Our method of motivation is in negative positive reinforcement. If you fail to complete your task, a pre-set monetary value is subtracted from your bank account and donated to a charity (we understand that different folks support different causes, so it's your choice!), through the Venmo API. Some of our users even opt for causes they are against, for an extra push to fulfilling their agendas!

Finish your tasks before you run out of money!

Charity or Me runs on BootStrap, making our app compatible with devices and screens of all makes and sizes.
