#CHARITY OR ME

The project is a todo-list web-based application for the purpose of inspiring humans to achieve our long and short term goals, from shipping a project to putting on socks.

Our method of motivation is in negative positive reinforcement. If you fail to complete your task, a pre-set monetary value is subtracted from your bank account and donated to a charity of your choice, through Venmo.

Finish your tasks before you run out of money.
